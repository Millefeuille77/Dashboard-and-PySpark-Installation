The dashboard data is taken from 1 January 2022 until 2 February 2022. This dashboard is used to monitor which pick up locations generate high and stable revenue and which companies is the market leader.

From this dashboard, we can get the insights Company 2 is the market leader in New York City and pickup location with ID 132 is the most stable. 
ID 132 is the busiest place, probably it is office areas because taxi orders from the location is the most stable even though it is declining through the month.
There is a spike on pickup location with ID 142, there is probably an event on that time that trigger the surge in taxi orders.
We can see on 29 January there is a drop activities from all of the taxi company, because a major winter storm and blizzard occured from 28 january and continued through 29 January.
